<strong><u>Module 5A – Pseudocode Assignment </u></strong>

For the problem statement below, you must write the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  The Pseudocode must be complete and following the standards listed at <a href="https://kennesawedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/dtatum7_kennesaw_edu/Documents/9.%20Capstone%20project%20final%20acceptance%20and%20assessment%20Hackthon%20Registration%20-%20Dawn%20Tatum.docx?web=1">http://ccse.kennesaw.edu/fye/Pseudocode.php</a>

<strong><u>Problem Statement</u></strong>:

Write a program to perform a bird survey to count the number of birds of each species in an area.  Create a class BirdSurvey that is a linked list.  The linked list can be one way linked list, circular linked list or a doubly linked list; whichever you choose.

BirdSurvey should have the following operations in addition to those normally found in your linked list class:

<ol>

 <li>add(<em>bird</em>) – adds the bird species <em>bird</em> to the end of the list, if it is not already there. sets its count to 1; otherwise, adds 1 to the count for <em>bird</em>.</li>

 <li>getCount(<em>bird</em>) – returns the count associated with the species <em>bird</em>. If <em>bird</em> is not on the list, returns zero.</li>

 <li>getReport() – displays the name and count for each bird species on the list.</li>

</ol>

You will write a program that uses BirdSurvey to record the data from a recent bird survey.  Use a loop to read bird names until <em>done</em> is entered.  Illustrate the use of each of the methods mentioned above, with the last being a Report of all the species of birds entered and the count for each species.

<strong><u>Break the problem down and write the pseudocode: </u></strong>

Break the problem statement into parts to fully understand what is expected as input, output and processes in your code.  Write down all the variables you will need from the problem statement.  Once you have broken down the problem, start writing your pseudocode.

Writing the pseudocode may take a while and several iterations to fully get the solution complete.  Walk through the problem and your pseudocode as if the program is running.

Now make sure that your pseudocode is the best it can be.  Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your pseudocode.

<strong><u>claModule 5B – Coding Assignment </u></strong>

For the problem statement below, you must review the Pseudocode for each part of the solution.  You will then write your code based on the feedback from your Pseudocode assignment.

<strong><u>Problem Statement</u></strong>:

Write a program to perform a bird survey to count the number of birds of each species in an area.  Create a class BirdSurvey that is a linked list.  The linked list can be one way linked list, circular linked list or a doubly linked list; whichever you choose.

BirdSurvey should have the following operations in addition to those normally found in your linked list class:

<ol>

 <li>add(<em>bird</em>) – adds the bird species <em>bird</em> to the end of the list, if it is not already there. sets its count to 1; otherwise, adds 1 to the count for <em>bird</em>.</li>

 <li>getCount(<em>bird</em>) – returns the count associated with the species <em>bird</em>. If <em>bird</em> is not on the list, returns zero.</li>

 <li>getReport() – displays the name and count for each bird species on the list.</li>

</ol>







You will write a program that uses BirdSurvey to record the data from a recent bird survey.  Use a loop to read bird names until <em>done</em> is entered.  Illustrate the use of each of the methods mentioned above, with the last being a Report of all the species of birds entered and the count for each species.







<strong><u>Start writing the code from your pseudocode:</u></strong>

Code the solution from your pseudocode. Compile and debug all parts of your program to ensure it is correct.




<strong><u>Test</u></strong>




Test your code with sample data.




Now make sure that your code is the best it can be.  Check your formatting, comments, and make sure your output is correct and communicates what is happening in your code.
